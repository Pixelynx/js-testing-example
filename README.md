## JavaScript Testing Workshop Example Repo

A little React app with tests that need some ❤️.

## Things you'll need

1. node. I use the popular tool [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install multiple versions of node and switch between them from project to project.
2. yarn. This has become the industry standard for managing node dependencies. (Installation instructions for many operating systems here.)[https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install] I installed mine with `brew install yarn`.

## Running the app

It's a [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) so you can run it in the usual way:

- `yarn install` // install node dependencies
- `yarn start` // run the development server
- navigate to localhost:3000

## Running tests

`yarn test` runs the tests in "watch mode". When you update the code, the tests will run themselves again.
